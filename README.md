products = session.query(Product).all()

with open('products_export.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['ID', 'Name', 'Price', 'Stock'])
    for product in products:
        writer.writerow([product.id, product.name, 
                        product.selling_price, product.stock_quantity])
```

### Import Data
